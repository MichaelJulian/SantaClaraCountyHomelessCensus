# Santa Clara County Homeless Census Survey

##### The most recent homeless census (2015) polled 953 of the 7,000 homeless in Santa Clara County.
Santa Clara County stretches from San Jose to Palo Alto, and up until recently, was home to the largest homeless encampment in America (the Jungle).

**This repository is dedicated to exploring data,** through Python and R, **understanding root problems of homelessness,** by finding trends and strong statistical relationships across age, gender, health conditions, length of homelessness, reasons for homelessness, family conditions, and location; **and finding effective solutions.**


# The Data

### scch_census.csv
The data has been cleaned to a single csv file, where columns are survey questions, mostly Yes/No answers (1/0).

### Survey questions
The anonymized data contains questions that include:
1. Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality
1. Reported reasons for homelessness
1. Obstacles to obtaining a job
1. Obstacles to obtaining housing
1. Government Assistance
1. Health Conditions


# Explorations

## Heatmap: Job Obstacles and Reason for Homelessness
![]('plots/heatmap_reasons_job.png')

## Heatmap: Job Obstacles and Reason for Homelessness for Females only
![]('plots/heatmap_reasons_job_female.png')
We can observe that subsetted by females, divorce/breakup becomes a much more likely answer as a reason for homelessness.
